# Constitution

## Purpose
This repository serves as a language-agnostic Spec-Kit template for spec-driven development. It provides a foundational structure that can be adapted for any technology stack.

## Principles

### 1. Specification-Driven Development
All development begins with clear specifications. Code implements specifications, not vice versa.

### 2. Language Agnostic
This template maintains neutrality regarding programming languages, frameworks, and tooling. Teams can adopt any technology stack that suits their needs.

### 3. Incremental Planning
Work is broken down into discrete, manageable tasks that can be tracked and validated independently.

### 4. Automation First
Repetitive processes are automated through workflows and scripts, reducing manual effort and human error.

### 5. Documentation as Code
Documentation lives alongside code, versioned and reviewed through the same processes.

## Structure

### /.specify
Core directory containing:
- `constitution.md` - This file, defining project principles
- `spec.md` - Technical specifications and requirements
- `plan.md` - High-level implementation plan
- `/tasks/` - Directory for individual task specifications

### /.github/workflows
Automation workflows for linting, validation, and task management.

## Governance

Changes to the constitution require explicit review and approval. The constitution serves as the foundational agreement for how the project operates.

## Adaptability

While this template is language-agnostic, teams should:
1. Add their chosen technology stack without removing template structure
2. Extend automation workflows as needed for their specific tools
3. Maintain the spec-driven approach regardless of implementation details
