# Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines how to use and extend this Spec-Kit template for your project.

## Phase 1: Template Adoption
**Status**: ✅ Complete

- [x] Initialize `.specify` directory structure
- [x] Create `constitution.md` with project principles
- [x] Create `spec.md` with technical specifications
- [x] Create this `plan.md` file
- [x] Create `tasks/` directory for task management
- [x] Set up GitHub workflow for automation
- [x] Document usage in README

## Phase 2: Project Initialization
**Status**: ⏳ Pending (User Action Required)

When starting a new project with this template:

- [ ] Clone or fork this repository
- [ ] Review and customize `constitution.md` for your team's principles
- [ ] Update `spec.md` with your project's technical requirements
- [ ] Modify this `plan.md` to reflect your implementation roadmap
- [ ] Add initial tasks to the `tasks/` directory
- [ ] Update README with project-specific information

## Phase 3: Technology Stack Integration
**Status**: ⏳ Pending (User Action Required)

Add your chosen technology stack:

- [ ] Add programming language(s) and runtime
- [ ] Configure build system and dependency management
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Add linting and code quality tools
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` for your stack
- [ ] Extend `spec-kit.yml` workflow with stack-specific checks

## Phase 4: Development Workflow
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Branching Strategy) / ⏳ Pending (Other Items)

Establish development practices:

- [x] Define branching strategy (see [BRANCHING.md](../BRANCHING.md))
  - Specification branches: `spec` for requirements and technical specifications
  - Planning branches: `plan` for implementation planning and task breakdown
  - Design branches: `design` for UI/UX artifacts and design systems
  - Implementation branches: `impl` for active development work
  - Development branches: `dev` for feature integration
  - Main branch: `main` as stable baseline
  - Test branches: `test` for continuous integration
  - Staging branches: `stage` for pre-production validation
  - Production branches: `prod` for deployed code
  - Documentation branches: `pages` and `gh-pages` for static sites
  - Knowledge branches: `codex` for code examples and tutorials
- [ ] Set up code review process
- [ ] Configure issue templates
- [ ] Create pull request templates
- [ ] Document development setup
- [ ] Establish testing requirements
- [ ] Define deployment procedures

## Using Spec-Kit Commands

### Viewing Specifications
```bash
# Constitution
cat .specify/constitution.md

# Specifications
cat .specify/spec.md

# Plan
cat .specify/plan.md

# Tasks
ls -la .specify/tasks/
cat .specify/tasks/<task-name>.md
```

### Creating Tasks
Create new task files in `.specify/tasks/` following this template:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

## Objective
[What needs to be accomplished]

## Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

## Implementation Notes
[Technical details and considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Status
[Not Started | In Progress | Complete]
```

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Regular Reviews
- Review constitution quarterly for relevance
- Update specifications as requirements change
- Keep plan synchronized with actual progress
- Archive completed tasks

### Continuous Improvement
- Gather feedback from team members
- Refine processes based on experience
- Update automation workflows
- Share learnings and best practices

## Success Metrics

- All team members understand the constitution
- Specifications remain current and accurate
- Plan reflects actual project state
- Tasks are granular and actionable
- Workflows provide value through automation
