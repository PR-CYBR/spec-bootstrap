## Tips for Creating Tasks

1. **Keep tasks focused**: Each task should address one specific goal
2. **Make requirements measurable**: Use concrete, testable criteria
3. **Provide context**: Include relevant technical details
4. **Define success**: Clear acceptance criteria prevent scope creep
5. **Track progress**: Update status as work progresses
